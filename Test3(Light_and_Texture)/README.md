This C++ code represents an OpenGL application that creates a window, renders 3D objects, and handles various user interactions. The program includes features like lighting, texturing, and various settings that can be toggled through keyboard input. It also supports resizing, window management, and full-screen mode.

1. **Include Statements:**
   - `#include <GL/glut.h>`: Includes the GLUT library for creating and managing the OpenGL window.
   - `#include <vector>`: Includes the C++ vector container for holding image data.
   - `"lodepng.h"`: Custom library for image loading.
   - `<iostream>`: Includes the C++ standard library for input and output.

2. **Function Prototypes:**
   - Prototypes for functions used in the application, such as initialization, rendering, resizing, and various user interactions.

3. **Global Variables:**
   - Several global boolean and floating-point variables control the application state. These include settings for fullscreen mode, mouse interaction, and animation. Other variables manage rotations, window dimensions, textures, and lighting.

4. **`main` Function:**
   - The `main` function initializes GLUT, sets the window's initial position and size, defines display and interaction callback functions, and enters the main loop.

5. **`drawPlane` Function:**
   - This function creates a grid-like plane with texture coordinates. It generates rows and columns of vertices, setting up the plane to be used for texturing.

6. **`init` Function:**
   - The `init` function initializes various aspects of the application, including the clear color, depth testing, lighting, texture loading, and texture filtering.

7. **`display` Function:**
   - The `display` function is responsible for rendering the 3D scene. It sets up the view and projection matrices, applies rotations, and draws objects. Lighting and material properties are also set up.

8. **`resize` Function:**
   - The `resize` function handles window resizing by updating the viewport and projection matrix based on the window dimensions.

9. **`idle` Function:**
   - The `idle` function rotates the scene when the mouse is not interacting, controlled by the `animation` variable.

10. **`keyboard` Function:**
    - The `keyboard` function responds to keyboard input for various features. It allows the user to toggle animation, lighting, smooth shading, texturing, texture modes, filters, and other settings.

11. **`specialKeyboard` Function:**
    - The `specialKeyboard` function handles special keys, including the F1 key, which toggles full-screen mode.

12. **Mouse Interaction Functions (`mouse` and `mouseMotion`):**
    - The `mouse` function tracks mouse button clicks and updates the mouse down state. The `mouseMotion` function handles mouse movement and updates the rotation based on mouse input.
